            <h2>About</h2>
            
                <p>Pneumonia is an inflammation of the air sacs in the lungs (alveoli) and the surrounding tissue. It often leads to a sudden high fever, feeling unwell, a cough, and shortness of breath.</p>
                <p>Because pneumonia is usually caused by bacteria, it can generally be treated effectively with antibiotics. Vaccinations that can prevent infection by certain germs are also available.</p>
                <p>People in good health generally recover within a few weeks, but pneumonia shouldn't be taken lightly. It may take several months to regain full strength.</p>
                
                <h3>Types of Pneumonia</h3>
                <p>Pneumonia can be caused by a variety of different pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi. The most common bacterial cause is <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i>, while viruses like the flu virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are also frequent culprits.</p>
                <p>Other types of pneumonia include aspiration pneumonia (caused by inhaling food, liquid, or vomit) and fungal pneumonia, which can be seen in individuals with weakened immune systems.</p>
                
                <h3>Risk Factors</h3>
                <p>While pneumonia can affect anyone, certain groups of people are at higher risk. These include children under 2 years old, adults over 65, people with chronic health conditions like asthma, COPD, or heart disease, and those with weakened immune systems due to conditions like cancer or HIV.</p>
                <p>Smoking, a sedentary lifestyle, and poor nutrition can also increase the risk of developing pneumonia.</p>
                
                <h3>Diagnosis of Pneumonia</h3>
                <p>Diagnosing pneumonia involves a physical examination, listening for crackling sounds in the lungs, and tests such as chest X-rays, blood tests, and sometimes sputum cultures to identify the specific cause of the infection.</p>
                <p>X-rays play a crucial role in detecting pneumonia, as they can reveal fluid in the lungs, areas of inflammation, or infection. This is why the analysis of chest X-rays is integral in diagnosing pneumonia early and accurately.</p>
                
                <h3>Treatment and Prevention</h3>
                <p>Treatment for pneumonia depends on the cause and severity. Antibiotics are used to treat bacterial pneumonia, while antiviral medications may be used for viral pneumonia. Supportive care, including rest, fluids, and fever-reducing medications, is often recommended as well.</p>
                <p>Vaccines are available to prevent certain types of pneumonia, especially those caused by bacteria like <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> and the flu virus. Regular hand hygiene and avoiding close contact with sick individuals can also help reduce the risk of pneumonia.</p>
