###Pneumonia Detection Using CNN

##Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting pneumonia from chest X-ray images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Pneumonia is a severe respiratory infection, and early and accurate detection can greatly improve patient outcomes. The trained model is deployed locally using Flask and provides predictions via a user-friendly web interface.

##Features
#Dataset: Utilized a chest X-ray dataset with both normal and pneumonia-labeled images.
#Model: Designed and implemented a CNN with multiple convolutional, pooling, and dense layers for image classification.
#Performance: Achieved an accuracy of 80.61% after training the model for 200 epochs.
#Deployment: The model is integrated into a Flask web application for local use.
#Web Interface: A website allows users to upload chest X-ray images and receive predictions in real-time.
#Error Handling: Implemented robust input validation and error reporting.
